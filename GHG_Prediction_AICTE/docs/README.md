# Week2
During this week, we carried out the following data preprocessing and exploration steps:

Step 1: Removed the ‘Unnamed: 7’ column, as it contained no meaningful data.
Step 2: Explored the DataFrame by examining column names, data types, and non-null counts using df.info(), and viewed summary statistics with df.describe().
Step 3: Verified the absence of null values after removing the unnecessary column.
Step 4: Plotted a histogram to analyze the distribution of the target variable, ‘Supply Chain Emission Factors with Margins’.
Step 5: Investigated the categorical variables ‘Substance’, ‘Unit’, and ‘Source’ by checking their unique values and encoding them into numerical format.
Step 6: Dropped the ‘Name’, ‘Code’, and ‘Year’ columns, considering them irrelevant to the modeling process.
Step 7: Split the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y) to prepare for machine learning.
Step 8: Conducted both univariate and multivariate analysis—used count plots for categorical features and a correlation heatmap for numerical ones to study inter-variable relationships.
Step 9: Identified the top 10 industries with the highest average supply chain emission factors by grouping and visualizing the data.
